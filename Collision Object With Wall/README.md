# Collision_Objects_With_Wall:
Given two objects of mass m1 and m2 (m2=m1*pow(10,n)). Object m1 is located between m2 and a wall. Initially m1 is stationary, m2 moves towards object m1 and the wall with a non-zero initial velocity. Find the number of collisions between the two objects until the two objects can no longer collide, knowing that the collisions that occur are elastic.
